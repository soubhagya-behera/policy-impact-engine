# Policy Impact Engine — Project Status

**Project:** Policy Impact Engine
**Repository:** policy-impact-engine

## Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 4.1.1
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Web MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Validation
- Lombok

## Database

PostgreSQL database: `policypulse`

The database name `policypulse` is retained intentionally. No rename is planned as part of the current phase.

## Completed

- Initial Spring Boot backend created
- PostgreSQL connectivity verified
- GitHub repository created
- Git initialized
- Initial backend committed and pushed
- Project renamed from PolicyPulse to Policy Impact Engine
- Java package renamed to `com.soubhagya.policyimpactengine`
- Main application class renamed to `PolicyImpactEngineApplication`
- `application.properties` Git-ignored (local configuration only)
- `application-example.properties` established as the GitHub-safe configuration template
- Clean Maven tests passing
- Spring Boot application startup verified against PostgreSQL
- Architecture designed and approved (see ARCHITECTURE.md and DECISIONS.md)

## Current Phase

**Phase 0 — Foundation: COMPLETE**

**Phase 1 — Policy Registration
Status: IN PROGRESS**

Completed:
- Policy persistence foundation
- Policy entity
- Policy repository
- Policy registration DTOs
- URL validation
- Policy service
- Policy controller

Remaining:
- RFC 7807/global exception handling
- remaining Phase 1 integration tests

## Next Phase

**Phase 1 — Policy Registration**

Phase 1 scope (foundation slice done; remainder not started):

- Policy entity — DONE
- Policy repository — DONE
- Flyway V1 policy schema — DONE
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` — DONE
- Testcontainers PostgreSQL repository tests — DONE (foundation slice)
- Policy registration DTOs — DONE
- URL validation — DONE (registration-time syntactic rules; network-level SSRF checks belong to the fetch phase)
- Policy service — DONE (registration + retrieval, mocked unit tests)
- Policy controller — DONE (registration/retrieval endpoints, WebMvcTest slice tests)
- Global exception handling / RFC 7807 — not started
- remaining Phase 1 tests — not started

## Current Status

Phase 1 foundation slice implemented and tested successfully
(Flyway V1 migration, Policy entity, Policy repository,
Testcontainers repository tests passing).

Phase 1B slice implemented and tested successfully
(registration DTOs, deterministic URL validation with unit tests).

Phase 1C slice implemented and tested successfully
(policy service with mocked unit tests).

Phase 1D slice implemented and tested successfully
(policy controller with WebMvcTest slice tests).

No Phase 1 exception-handling
work has been started.

## Next Action

The next implementation task is the remainder of Phase 1 — Policy Registration:
global RFC 7807 exception handling with its tests,
as scoped in ARCHITECTURE.md §31.
The persistence foundation, registration DTOs, URL validation,
policy service, and policy controller are already in place.
